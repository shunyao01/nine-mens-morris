To replicate and run the code locally, please follow the instructions below:

1. **Run the Nine Men's Morris.jar file**

    Navigate to the src folder and run the Nine Men's Morris.jar file directly. This should execute the application and launch the game.

2. **Alternative**

   If the first option fails, you can use IntelliJ IDE to run the code by following these steps:

   - Open the project in IntelliJ.
   - Locate the Application.java file in the project structure.
   - Right-click on the Application class and select "Run" from the context menu. This will execute the main method and start the game.

Please note that for both options, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and a compatible Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
